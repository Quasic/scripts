# scripts
JavaScript and other stuff I find useful in various projects

The Windows-only scripts, such as WSF, HTA, VBS, BATch, and PowerShell, have mostly been split out to [Quasic/wshta](https://github.com/Quasic/wshta).

The JavaScript format scripts been split out to [Quasic/jsformat](https://github.com/Quasic/jsformat).
