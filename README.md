# scripts
Scripts and miscellaneous stuff I find useful in various projects, but don't have a really good place for, yet. Once I find a better place, I'll split it there and note this below:

The Windows-only scripts, such as WSF, HTA, VBS, BATch, and PowerShell, have mostly been split out to [Quasic/wshta](https://github.com/Quasic/wshta).

JavaScript for the window object was split to [Quasic/dom](//github.com/Quasic/dom), unless it was JScript specific and included in the above.

Most of the remaining JavaScript has been split out to [jsformat](https://github.com/Quasic/jsformat) and [jsBinary](//github.com/Quasic/jsBinary).
