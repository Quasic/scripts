# scripts
JavaScript and other stuff I find useful in various projects

The Windows-only scripts, such as WSF, HTA, VBS, BATch, and PowerShell, have mostly been split out to [Quasic/wshta](https://github.com/Quasic/wshta).

The JavaScript format scripts have mostly been split out to [jsformat](https://github.com/Quasic/jsformat) and [jsBinary](//github.com/Quasic/jsBinary).
