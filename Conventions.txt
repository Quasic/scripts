I use a nonstandard whitespace format that makes my JavaScript look like minJS output. It helps keep diffs simpler, because indents don't change when another if statement is added. I developed it before I used git, so more code could fit on the screen at a time. Tools can reformat the code, so I'm just leaving it the way I use it. Indents mark the line, rather than code structure, though these sometimes overlap.
