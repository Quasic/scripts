I use a nonstandard whitespace format that makes my JavaScript look like minJS output. It helps keep diffs simpler, because indents don't change when another if statement is added. I developed it before I used git, so more code could fit on the screen at a time. Tools can reformat the code, so I'm just leaving it the way I use it. Indents mark the line, rather than code structure, though these sometimes overlap. 

JavaScript files typically contain only one object. Filenames are the object name, or names joined by symbols, with the. .js extension. 

VBscript files define various subs and functions with the filename prefixing each.
